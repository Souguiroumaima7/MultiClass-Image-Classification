# MultiClass-Image-Classification
In this project, we address a multiclass image classification problem using transfer learning with the InceptionResNetV2 model. Transfer learning allows us to leverage the knowledge of a pre-trained model to classify images into multiple categories without starting from scratch. In this case, we utilize the InceptionResNetV2 model, which has been pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. The objective is to fine-tune the model to classify images into multiple categories by customizing the last few layers according to the new dataset.

We will begin by loading the pre-trained InceptionResNetV2 model, excluding its top layers (fully connected layers), and then adding new dense layers to adjust it for our specific classification task. The model will then be trained on a custom dataset of labeled images. The classification task could involve distinguishing between different types of objects such as animals, flowers, or various dog breeds, depending on the dataset provided.

# Tech Stack
1/ Python: Programming language used for developing the model.
2/ TensorFlow: Deep learning framework for implementing and training neural networks.
3/ Keras: High-level API of TensorFlow used to simplify model building and training.
4/ InceptionResNetV2: Pre-trained convolutional neural network used as the backbone for transfer learning.
5/ NumPy: Library for numerical operations.
6/ Pandas: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
7/ Matplotlib & Seaborn: Used for visualizing the training process and results.
8/ OpenCV: Used for image preprocessing and augmentation.

# Key Steps:
1- Data Preprocessing: Images are preprocessed to the required input size of 299x299 pixels, and data augmentation techniques are applied to increase the dataset's diversity.
2- Transfer Learning Setup: The InceptionResNetV2 model is loaded with pre-trained weights from ImageNet, and the top layers are customized to fit the new dataset.
3- Model Customization: New dense layers are added to the base model, along with a softmax activation function to handle multiclass classification.
4- Training: The model is fine-tuned on the custom dataset using an appropriate loss function (categorical cross-entropy) and optimizer (Adam or RMSprop).
5- Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and other metrics on the test dataset.
6- Deployment: The trained model is saved and can be used to predict new image classifications.

# conclusion 

The multiclass image classification using transfer learning with InceptionResNetV2 proved to be an efficient approach. By leveraging the power of pre-trained models, we significantly reduced the time and computational resources required to train a deep neural network. The model successfully learned to classify images into multiple categories with high accuracy. This approach is highly adaptable and can be extended to other classification problems by using different datasets and pre-trained models. Transfer learning thus remains a powerful tool in modern deep learning, especially when working with limited datasets.
